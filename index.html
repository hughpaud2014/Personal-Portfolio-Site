    <h1>Welcome! My name is Paul Hughes.</h1>
    <p>I am currently an Independent Contractor for Hughes Xploration Holdings, LLC, a small business I formulated due
        to an
        increase of requests for my services as a technical advisor and engineer. I have been in the oil and gas
        industry for 20
        years. I broke out in this industry as an equipment manager until discovering my technical aptitude, which paved
        the way
        for my career as an engineering director.
        As a child, I was known to dismantle electronics, read technical instructions to reconstruct the electronics I
        took
        apart. My late father discovered this and introduced me to my first computer, the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color
        Computer 2;
        this will also introduce me to the Microsoft BASIC programming language.
        I have been a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 2008 and a member of the San Antonio Chamber of
        Commerce.
